                The main deity at the temple is known as Poongavanathu Amman.[2] The goddess appears in the form of a natural anthill resembling a woman suffering from labour pain, lying with her mouth open.[1] Owing to the presence of Shiva inside the sanctum sanctorum, the idol of Nandi is present in front of the sanctum instead of a lion found normally in a Devi temple, which is considered a rarity.[3] There are shrines to Ganesh, Nataraja, and the philosopher-saint Valluvar near the sanctum sanctorum. Nataraja is known by the name Thandavarayan.[2][4] The sacred tree of the temple is a neem tree located in the outer corridor. Other shrines at the outer corridor include a sacred anthill and shrines of goddess Karumari, Ganesh, and Nagadevas (serpent deities) under the sacred tree.[2] Devotees believe that worshiping the goddess fulfills their wish for a child.[5][6][7]
