                The church serves Christ The King Catholic Parish, which covers Nakasero, Kololo, and Old Kampala.[3] Many worshippers, however, come from other parts of the city and surrounding neighborhoods to pray at this location.[3] As of September 2016, the seating capacity inside the church was about 600.[4] Because of the size of the congregation, there is insufficient space inside the church to accommodate all the worshippers. During mass and other large events, tents are erected outside the church where worshippers follow the proceedings on loudspeakers.[3]
