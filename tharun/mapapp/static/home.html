                The first railway proposals for India were made in Madras in 1832. The country's first transport train, Red Hill Railway (built by Arthur Cotton to transport granite for road-building), ran from Red Hills to the Chintadripet bridge in Madras in 1836-1837.[1] A town named Sholavaram has a unused airstrip build by British for World War II. It was originally operated by the Royal Air Force as an airbase during World War II. After the war, it was abandoned until the airstrip was turned into a venue for drag racing. Most notably, the Malayalam actor Jayan was killed in a helicopter accident here during the shooting of his film Kolilakkam on 16 November 1980.
